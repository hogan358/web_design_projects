<h1>Hello World!</h1>

<hr>

<h2>A Place I Would Like To Visit</h2>
<p>I would like to travel to <a href="https://www.discovergreece.com/en" target="_blank">Greece.</a>
    <br>
    <img src="Greece.jpg" alt="A Photo of Greece"/>
    <br>
    It is a place that I have always felt connected and drawn to. Greece is absolutely stunning and the food is just as much a reason to visit.
    Spanakopita, stuffed grape leaves, lamb, olives, and Baklava are just some of the amazing dishes originating from Greece.
    To experience Greece in an authentic way would be so fulfilling. I think I would love being in such a romantic and magical place.</p>

<h2>A person I admire <br> (past or present)</h2>
<P>A person that I admire is the performer <a href="https://www.eltonjohn.com" target="_blank">Elton John.</a>
    <br>
    <img src="Elton.jpg" alt="Young Elton John"/>
    <br>
    I find a lot of joy in his music and his extravagant outfits. His music is some of the most influential in both the time it
    was released and now. Not only that, but he is also an activist. He has raised, given money, and directly helped those
    effected by AIDS. His organization is one of the biggest donors to the cause. Elton overcame addiction, dependency,
    and mental illness and took control of his iconic career.</P>
