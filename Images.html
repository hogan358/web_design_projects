<h2>My Favorite Animal Is An Opossum</h2>

<p>My favorite animal is an Opossum. They are the only marsupial in North American and do a lot of good for our environment.<br>
    They eat ticks, bugs, and trash which reduces waste and our risk of getting things like lime disease. Opossums are also very <br>
    unlikely to carry rabies as well as be affected by snake venom.</p>
